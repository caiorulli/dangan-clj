Dangan-clj is a (work-in-progress) game framework for writing investigative visual novels using Clojure.

It is freely based on the Danganronpa series (and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series as well) narrative structure, in which there are different stages of investigation and trial. Also a very good excuse to learn better Clojure.

So far, it's meant to be an text-based CLI game, but that is subject to change. It is intended to be a library in the future, but for development purposes I have been developing an example game along with it, so I can clearly separate game from library in afterwards.

## To run the example game so far...

Just go with `lein run`.
If you want to run the tests, it's `lein midje`.
