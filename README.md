Dangan-clj is a work-in-progress game (lib? framework?) for writing investigative visual novels using Clojure.

It is freely based on the Danganronpa series (and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney series as well) narrative structure, in which there are different stages of investigation and trial. Also a very good excuse to learn better Clojure.

## State of Development

I was trying to make up my mind of what could this become; it started out as a CLI, then I tried writing a CLJS app...
In the end, I think I'd be better off trying not to build everything from scratch. There are lots of amazing engines out there such as [renpy](https://github.com/renpy/renpy). If needed be, extending existing projects would be a better choice.
Therefore, I've archived this.
